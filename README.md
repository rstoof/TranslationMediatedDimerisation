# TranslationMediatedDimerisation


In these notebooks we show how Translation mediated dimerisation affects non-linear dynamics.

In "Repressilator.nb", the general model is applied to the repressilator, where dimerisation is seen to affect oscillations.
The derivation for the value for bisfurcation is shown.


In "ToggleSwitch.nb" we show how the  switch can be enhanced using spatial design.
