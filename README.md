# TranslationMediatedDimerisation


In these notebooks we show how Translation mediated dimerisation affects non-linear dynamics.

In "OverlappingSpheres.nb" we show how the equation for Translation Mediated Dimerisation is derived. Here we also show the code we used to make Figure2 in DOI:......

In "Repressilator.nb", the general model is applied to the repressilator, where dimerisation is seen to affect oscillations.
The derivation for the value for bifurcation is shown.


In "ToggleSwitch.nb" we show how the  switch can be enhanced using spatial design.
